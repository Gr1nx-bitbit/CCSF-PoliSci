# Lesson 10.2: Presidency
### Introduction
Presidency is the branch of government meant to enforce laws and tends to be more powerful than the other branches even though congress should be first. Since the president has the most individual power in government a lot is expected from them, however they usually get blamed for any national crisis - their honeymoon lasts about a 100 days. 

### Formal Powers
The president has the following powers outline by the constitution (some are vague):
- Power to enforce laws --> while the constitution says that the president should take care that all laws are executed faithfully, they spend much more time making policy instead of enforcing it. 
- Power to veto --> This is a check on legislation that allows the president to send legislation back to congress - they can overrule this decision by a 2/3s vote from each house. 
- Can appoint officials but this can be checked by congress
- Highest ranking army official although congress is the one who can declare war
- Pardoning people as a check on the courts
Presidential power has expanded by implication i.e. some presidents calimed some power or did something that the judiciary and legislative branches didn't strike down which then become powers of proceeding presidents. Two examples of implied powers are:
- Executive orders: policies put on federal departments or agencies which are treated as law but don't have to be approved by congress. 
- Signing statements: statements made after signing a bill into law

### The Power of Persuasion
Presidents have a great platform to persuade people hence all the speeches. A presidents power increases with their popularity. The president is also known as the cheif lobbyist. 

### Limits of Presedential Power
Social and economic deficits reflect poorly on the president limitng their power. 

# 10.3: How does the Electoral College Work?
Electoral colleges are a form of indirect elections. When you vote for a president, you're actually voting for a person who is pledged to the president - whichever pledge has the majority decides the president - also the number of electors per state = HoR seats + senators. 

# 10.4: Electoral College Information
If no candidate gets the popular vote, it goes down to the HoR. 

# 10.6: Bureaucracy
### The Fourth Branch of Government
Little about government administration is covered in the constitution - however it is a keystone of government today due to its size and complexity. Bureaucracy is kind of like the structure within federal departments which is up to congress. 

### Beureaucracy Defined
- Heirarchy: clear chain of command and responsibility
- Specialization: tasks divided by expertise
- Explicit rules: rules over preferences
- Merit: hiring based on exams and experience

### Organization of the Federal Bureaucracy
Some cabinet members can actually oppose the president and my be elected at conventions.
