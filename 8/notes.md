# Lesson 8.2: Interest Groups and Social Movements

### What is an Interest Group?
An **interest group** is just a group of people interested in an issue; these could be Parent Teacher Associations or church groups - based on one or more shared attitudes, interest groups will make claims about other groups in society. The difference between political groups and interest groups is that **political groups are concerned with governance** (need to compromise) while **interest groups are concered with influence**. 

### Social Capital
Social capital is a social framework and social orginzations that facilitate co-operation and coordination for mutal benefit - basically it's working together to accomplish something more than an indvidual could. Social capital relys on how many people you have for your cause. 

### The Lobbying Game
The *inside game* is using lobbying to directly advocate for your interest. **Lobbying** is not just paying people! - lobbying is directly interacting with public officials for the purpose of influencing political decisions like legislation! The *outside game* consists of indirect lobbying, or trying to influence the public in some way to put pressure on legislators to pass something in favor of your interests - think of all those political ads you've been seeing! 

### Social Movements
Social movements are sustained (over a period of time - not episodic), collective (communities and not individuals), public (done in the public eye such as on the streets or TV), and extra institutional tactic (revolts, obstruction of certain activites, dress codes that signify the movement) actions.

# Documentary
Cesar Chaves and Dolores Huerta built a union after a cheap labor supply (laborers from Mexico for soldiers overseas) had been broken - slowly acrewed people into their union (11:00). In 1965 Chavez lead a 300 mile pilgramage from Delano to Sacramento. The protest/pilgramage ended up in over 10,000 people at Sacramento. Chavez national iconess started uprooting some self-depricating aspects of ?Mexican? culture (influenced by american culture) so Mexican people started to take more pride in their history and heritage - more awareness of identity upped boosted self worth (25:50). Walkouts from high schools in east LA for two weeks eventually led to meetings with adminastrators and parents - the 1970's saw more latinos attending college. Gutierez formed a poltical party called "La Raza Unida" and eventually had it become national but eventually disbanded in the early 1970's after an anti-war demonstration was broken up. Willie Velaquez took gerrymandering people to court so that the Chicano vote would actually hold weight.
