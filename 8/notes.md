# Lesson 8.2: Interest Groups and Social Movements

### What is an Interest Group?
An **interest group** is just a group of people interested in an issue; these could be Parent Teacher Associations or church groups - based on one or more shared attitudes, interest groups will make claims about other groups in society. The difference between political groups and interest groups is that **political groups are concerned with governance** (need to compromise) while **interest groups are concered with influence**. 

### Social Capital
Social capital is a social framework and social orginzations that facilitate co-operation and coordination for mutal benefit - basically it's working together to accomplish something more than an indvidual could. Social capital relys on how many people you have for your cause. 

### The Lobbying Game
The *inside game* is using lobbying to directly advocate for your interest. **Lobbying** is not just paying people! - lobbying is directly interacting with public officials for the purpose of influencing political decisions like legislation! The *outside game* consists of indirect lobbying, or trying to influence the public in some way to put pressure on legislators to pass something in favor of your interests - think of all those political ads you've been seeing! 

### Social Movements
Social movements are sustained (over a period of time - not episodic), collective (communities and not individuals), public (done in the public eye such as on the streets or TV), and extra institutional tactic (revolts, obstruction of certain activites, dress codes that signify the movement) actions.
