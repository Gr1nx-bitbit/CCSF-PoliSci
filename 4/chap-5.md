**Public opinion** is the collective attitude of citizens on an issue (114). Ban lifted from openly gay people serving in the military in 2011 (114). Immigration reform is stalled in congress (114). The public has power over the gov since they vote and favor or disfavor certain policies and actions (114). 

#### Public Opinions and the Models of Democracy
Before the 1930's people kinda just guessed what public opinion was since they didn't have polling yet (115). While the national gov should do what the majority wants, sometimes, they're not coherent in their desires while minority groups usually are (116). There is the **pluralist model** (more attention to politcally active and engaged groups, assumes majority of public is uninformed) and the **majoritarian model** (follows will of the public and assumes public knows what they want) [117]. 

#### The Distribution of Public Opinion
Measuring public opinion can be a bit iffy; there's a lot of people in the US so we rely on sampling to get a representation of the whole nation (117). 3 things that affect sample size are (117):
- Randomness (equal chance of citizens being chosen) [118]
- Size of the sample - bigger means better
- Amount of variation - one person does not rep the nation 100% therefore we need a lot of variation to get all sides of the story

There are some common distributions in polls (120):
- Skewed - generally bell curved but asymmetric distribution [bell curve top kind of leans in a direction] (of opinions)
- Bimodal - A poll showing two responses being chosen as frequently as each other
- Noraml - just a bell curve

Normal distributions generally mean the public are willing to support moderate policies for the specific issue. Skewed distributions generally mean the public isn't really burning about the issue and agree for the most part. **Stable distribution** means little change in public opinion over time i.e. the polls haven't really change even if the wording is different, however, if the same question has wildly different poll results, public opinion has probably changed (121).

#### Political Socialization
**Political socialization** is the process by which people form political beliefs (122). In forming values, the first thing is usally the best, and the rest of our learnings are based off of our previous or first learnings (122). The agents of early socialization start with family since that's what you're first exposed to (122-23). While parents plant the seed for values, school constructs children's ideas of what political processes are and how they work (123). Community and peers also influence your ideologies since you might want to fit in or stick out, be pressured or encouraged to or from some belief (124). Socialization continues throughout life and is more influenced by peers and media as you get older since school and community have probably waned (124). 

#### Social Groups and Political Values
While people have unique political views, they also have some similar political opinions (125). Education exposes people to new views and opinions, and, generally, people who are educated have different views than those who are less so (126-127). Income and region also affect people's opinions (127). African Americans and Latinos both tend to vote liberal (128). Minority groups tend to have worse **socio-economic status** (129). Religion also affects your political views (129-130). Gender also plays a role with women tending to be more democratic and men more republican (130).

#### From Values to Ideology
**Ideological terms** are kinda like the vocabulary of political science and is a way of describing the gov in a formal manner (130-131). The majority of people identify as liberal or conservative nowadays more on what they think liberals/conservatives symbolize instead of the actual ideological terms like degree of gov intervention (131). Liberals are more wiling to give up freedom for equality while conservatives are willing to give up freedom for order (132).

#### Freed, Order, or Equality
Our current scale for identifying political statures is too simple and reduces the options that people have to identify themselvse; since a lot of people have both liberal and conservative views, they don't really have any other choice besides "moderate" (133). 

#### Forming Political Opinions
If most citizens aren't idealogues (people who use ideological terms and have all their facts), how much political knowledge do they actually have; media and what it highlights is a big medium by which people get informed (135). While the collective opinion of the nation might seem stable, sometimes people are just misinformed on a topic and sometimes people are not willing to let go of their beliefs [the phenomenon people holding onto their beliefs more after being shown evidence of their falsity is called the **backfire effect**] (136). The **self-interest principle** states that people support policies that will benefit them (137). **Sociotropic responses** are ones that are based off the state of the country instead of one's individual circumstance (137). Political leaders also have an impact on what policies people vote for (study done - 137). Political leaders also try to sway and manipulate public opinions by way of framing issues in specific ways (138).
