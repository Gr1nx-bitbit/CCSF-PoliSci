### 2.2: Political Culture and Ideology

**Political ideologies** are a set of beliefs on how people should live together and the proper role that government should play in their lives. American political system founded on:
- Focus on personal freedoms
- Limited governance so we can enjoy those freedoms
Basically, people belived that the government should protect their base lines (Political Ideology). Political Culture is kinda like the feelings people have towards shared values I think. Political subcultures can also form in seperate communities like California about eviornmental protection. America is kinda odd compared to other countries due to its focus on individualism.
