### 2.2: Political Culture and Ideology

**Political ideologies** are a set of beliefs on how people should live together and the proper role that government should play in their lives. American political system founded on:
- Focus on personal freedoms
- Limited governance so we can enjoy those freedoms
Basically, people belived that the government should protect their base lines (Political Ideology). Political Culture is kinda like the feelings people have towards shared values I think. Political subcultures can also form in seperate communities like California about eviornmental protection. America is kinda odd compared to other countries due to its focus on individualism. 

### 2.4: 'What is the American Dream?' by Jennifer Hochschild

#### The Meaning of Success
Success has myriad meanings. The first part of success is achieving a better life than which you started with. Another part of success is that it can be relative i.e. you can be successful relative to someone you know. The tenets of success is that if you work hard and fair, you'll get the chance to go as far as you can -->

1. Who can pursue success:
Most americans believe anyone can pursue success no matter their current status

2. What does one pursue?
Basically your standard of living or what you anticipate (like what you want for your birthday, just scaled up)

3. How does one pursue success?
Through the power of your actions and controlling what you can

4. Why is success worth pursuing?
Because it's virtuous or makes you virtuous or can only be done if you're virtuous. Honesty and responsibility. Ethics

The American dream + scarce resources creates a different America since only a few people will actually be able to succeed.

Flaws in the tenets of the American Dream

1. In reality, only recently have most americans been able to actually pursue the American dream. Most americans are not very rich and have a lot of resources to their names. For most of American history, it was pretty much only white immigrants who were able to ride the wave of the industrial revolution and get into comfort. 

2. The second tenet only holds true so long as there are enough resources for people to use to get themselves a better life. If you don't have the resources, you can't pursue anything. The mentaility of always winning can also have a burden on those with material wealth, leaving them incapable of being grateful to what they already have; that same mentality also means it is almost culturally unacceptable to be poor / not successful. 

3. Anyone who fails is to be seen as spineless. 

4. Virtues of one group can be used against another group e.g. if asians can be the best students, why can't african americans do the same? Virtuous success can also be the dominance of one group over another. 

#### Flaws in the American Dream

2. Narrowing Success
Everything is based on money even though the american dream is supposed to allow you to pursue beliefs and modes of life not necessarily dominated by monetary worth

3. The Ideology as a Deception
The american dream leads people to beleive that their own life choices are what brought them to where they are. It does not humor the notion of focusing on the nationally macroscopic processes like poitical constraints or the economy for being the reason behind social ordering.
