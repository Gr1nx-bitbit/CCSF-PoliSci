Politics seems to be about the balance between freedom, order, and equality (4). **Norms** are certain values that the gov wants to reinforce (4). **Globalization** is the increased interdependency of nations and people (5). 

#### The Globalization of the American Government
**Sovereignty** is the right for each nation to govern its people how it sees fit (has to be externally recognized - 5). Globalization threatens sovereingty by having nations hold each other accountable (5). Examples of globalization and svereignty (7).

#### The Purposes of Government
Governments require that citizens give up some personal freedom since they need to exert control (7). The main purposes of government are (7):
- Maintaining order (7-9):
    - Maintaing order means to enact laws that preserve life and protect property. Some philospohers tried to tackle the problem of what it means to govern. **Liberalism** is a doctrine that states that the state should leave citizens free to further their own pursuits (8). **Communism** is a philospohy that gives ownership of all land and production to the people. 
- Providing Public Goods (9):
    - **Public goods** are benefits, services, or projects that benefit all citizens, but that are not likely to be produced by individuals (building roads, parks, providing sanitation, etc.). There is controversy in the US about how much the government should be able to take on public good affairs; some people think it should be left up to private businesses.
- Promoting Equality (9-10):
    - There's controversy about taxation for public goods and even more so for taxation for welfare (the govs way of reducing inequality by proving income, healthacare, etc.). Redistributing income has become a somewhat normal function of government by taking more money from the wealthy and using it to help the poor. Social equality isn't strictly monetary, however, and can be influenced by policies. 

#### A Conceptual Framework for Analyzing Government
To understand government, we have to understand the trade off between freedom and benefit (11). The five concepts that this text uses to analyze political events can be grouped into two categories: values pursued by the government and models of democratic government (11). 

#### The Concepts of Freedom, Order, and Equality
- Freedom (12-13):
    - **Freedom** is the abscence of constraints in behavior which coincides with liberty. **Freedom from** is more immunity from something and in this book, this is synonomous with eqaulity (freedom from wealth inequality). 
- Order (13-14)
    - Apart from the basic definiton of preserving life and protecting property, most people assocaite order with social order (the expected way of doing things such as what clothes to wear where, what you can publish, how you should act) but most people don't think social order is a legitamte function of the government (would abortion fall under social order?). **Police power** is the govs authority to safegaurd safety, health, morals, and wellfare which can be used to maintain order. There's constant debate on how much police power the national gov should have; police power allows the state to act on individuals so if the national gov can do the same, they can start monitoring aspects of your life in reponse to threats such as 9/11 (more telecomuncations surveillance). Living in a **police state** means the gov uses its police power to regulate almost all aspects of your life. Social order can be changed internally and externally through revolutions and regime changes, respecitvely. Or they can be changed more gradually through the legal process. 
- Equality (14-15)
    - **Political equality** is the idea that every person has one vote, however, some people don't see this as being equal since some people have more infleunce over others (contacts, advertising). **Social equality** is equality in wealth, education, and status and some people believe we need it before we can have political equality. **Equality of opportunity** is the idea that each person is gaurunteed the same chances to succeed in life. **Eqaulity of outcome** means that the gov must ensure everyone is equal by redistributing wealth and status. **Rights** are the benefits of government that every citizen is entitled to. 

#### Two Dilemans of Government
The gov cannot pursue order or equality without infringing on your personal freedoms. Since communism gauruntees equality in wellfare, it has a very strict social order. The values of freedom and equality directly conflict; any policy that strengthens one of the values, weakens the other (16).

Eqaulity, just as order, impinges on freedom - the book lists many examples of creating a more equal nation whilst taking away certain people's freedom of choice (17). 

#### Ideology and the Scope of Government
A **political ideology** is a consistent set of beliefs about the purpse and scope of government (17). On the spectrum of the government doing everything to the government being null, here's a list of ideologies:
- Totalitarianism
    - The ideology that the government has unlimited power and is in control of every aspect of societal life, from education to personal behavior, everything you do is regulated under law (18).
- Socialism
    - This ideolgy holds that the government has power and can control the economy to an extent (it can regulate and control infrastructure related businesses - 18). There is a related ideology called **democratic socialsim** in which the ideology holds that the citizens have natural born rights and can determine the exten of government activity through elected officials (19).
- Capitalism
    - Gov has some say in the economy but supports free enterprise - private businesses working without gov regulation (19). 
- Libertarianism
    - Opposes all government action except the order necessary to preserve human life and protect property (19). Laissez faire is the economic policy libertarians advocate for that keep all gov intervention outside of the economy (19).
- Anarchism
    - The ideology that opposes all forms of government (20). 

Liberals tend to favor more government while conservatives favor less (20). However, sometimes liberals and conservatives hold differeing opinions from the theoretical liberal or conservative which stems from political ideology (20-21).

#### American Political Ideologies and the Purpose of Government
Instead of liberals wanting more government and conservatives less, nowadays, they differ on the purpose of government (21). **Conservatives** favor the gov mainting (social) order (21). Liberals don't shy away from using gov power, but they want to use it in a different way: to promote equality (21). Graph of what liberals, libertarians, conservatives, and communitarians want (22). **Communitarians** are people who are willing to have the gov both promote equality and maintain order (23).
