## Lesson: California and San Francisco Government
#### California State History
California became a state on September 9th, 1850 and adopted its flag in 1911. Sacramento is the capital of California. While the Federal gov only ackowleges the state government, the state can make as many municipal or local governments as it wants. Counties are Cali's way of making more local govs. In the early 1900's Cali went through the Progressive era which is kind of the reason counties came about bc people didn't want to just send a representative to Sacramento but instead actually have a direct impact on government. 

The **California Constitution** (CC) is the state's highest law of the land. The CC was written in 1879 and has been ammended over 500 times. Us californians have a bit more personal freedom than the federal gov allows. California has a big population and a lot of electoral college votes as well as a huge and diverse economy (lots of different industries: from agriculture to tech). 

#### California State Government Structure
Cali's state legislature is a bicameral body, meaning that bills must pass through two chambers AND be signed by the governer to be passed as state law. The **California State Assembly** (CSA or SA) is like the lower house since it has more connection to the people, more reps, and shorter terms. The SA has 80 members who serve 2 years terms. The elected are called Assembly members and usually have an office in Sacramento and in the place they represent. The Speaker of the Assembly is the most powerful in the SA, and has a lot of say on bills since they mostly start in the SA and is elected by votes from ALL members regardless of political party. There are also Assembly Majority and Minority leaders which come from the two most populus parties (democrats then republicans).

The **California State Senate** (CSS or SS) is the upper house with 40 members who serve 4 year terms; they have offices in Sac and their area of rep. The SS has majority and minority leaders (democratic then republican). 

Terms now have limits unlike before where people could just get re-elected. After a maximum amount of terms are reached, members can never serve again which has led to controversy since the members usually end up working for lobbyists or private interests leaving the public with new and unexperienced members. After a member reaches a term limit in one chamber, they can try for the other. A new law was passed that lets members stay in for more terms but in only one house, 6 terms for the SA and 3 terms for the SS. There is also an *Ethics law* which restricts a members infleunce on legislature while or after they are active to prevent unfair market reading or something. 

In the executive branch of California (the one that executes and enforces law), the Governer is the one at the top and is limited to two four year terms. They are elected during the president's middle of term. We can have Governers and Lieutenant Governers from different political parties and have had that happen (don't have to run as a *ticket*). 

The judiciary branch of California deals with trials and issuing rulings under Californian legal issues. The highest court in Cali is the California Supreme Court (CSC) which has 7 justices. Judges are elected by voters in California. Judges are usually appointed by the Governer. Justices serve 12 years on the CSC and there are not term limits for justices. 

#### San Francisco Government 
The document that sets the policy for our city and county gov (SF is a city and an indiviudal county) is called the *City Charter* which was revised substantially in 1990. 

SF has a legislative body called the *SF Board of Supervisiors* which has 11 members who can serve two 4 year terms. Each supervisor represents a geographical portion of SF. Relections are held I think every two years, where the relections for supervisors of even districts are held and the odd districts are held: they swtich, that's it, jeez.

SF's cheif executive is the Mayor who can serve two 4 year terms. 

SF uses ranked choice voting where people rank the candidates and where if a majority vote isn't reached, the candidate with the fewest votes have their votes redistributed to the other candidates. 

#### The Budget/Local Education Boards | Know Your Officials
SF has a balanced budget which means that the total revenue has to equal total spending, otherwise, cuts are made. Local education boards' members barely make any money.
