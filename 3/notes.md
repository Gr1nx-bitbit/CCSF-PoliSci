## The Path of the US Constitution

#### The Road to the Constitution
The constitution is the ultimate rule book for Americans, deciding who get what and how. Before the constitution we know today was made, there were the **articles of confederation** which failed. The articles were made with the idea of not wanting an all signle powerful nation in charge. 

The Provisions of the Articles:
1. A national government with a Congress empowered to make peace, coin money, appoint officers for an army, control the post office, and negotiate with Indian tribes
2. One vote in the Continental Congress for each state regardless of size
3. The vote of nine states to pass any measure; amendments had to be unanimous
4. Delegates selected to the Congress by their respective state legislatures
5. Because of the fear of a tyrannical ruler, no executive was created and the national government was quite weak

The articles were succesful with land annexing and land disputes as well as providing public goods (army, navy, post office). Some of the weaknesses of the articles were that states were represented (not individuals), just one branch (continental congress) which had no executive, no taxing power, no exclusive foreign policy power, no control over commerce, no changes could be ammended unless it was unanimous, and the national gov could make no real demands. The articles were eventually replaced since **there was no strong central gov to keep economic and politcal stability**. 

#### Elite Origins of the Constitution
The constitution was written by a cohort of elites. Guys who had a lot of governmental experience and who had, at the time, elite education. The constitution was influenced by greek, roman, and english ideas of government confluencing in due process, checks and balance, and republic, anti-respectively.

#### Constitutional Compromises
There were 3 compromises that had to be made to make the constitution:
- How large a central gov?
    - Federalism is the idea that there is a strong central gov (anti-fedaralist's don't be lieve this). Federal systems give power to the states as well as the national gov; which powers go to the state, and which to the national?
- Representation of small vs large states in legislature
    - If representation was proportional, all the power would fall to the large states (Virginia plan), whereas the New Jersey plan wanted equal power for each state. The Conneticut Compromise has a bit of both plans; there are two houses of congress, the House of Represenatities, and the Senate. The House of Representatives was more reasonable in scale back in 1789 with a 1:30,000 scale while today its 1:750,000. The house of reps is elected by people proportionally (56 reps, now ~450) while the Senate gets two senators from each state, all with equal power.
- Slavery
    - Slaves counting as people would give the Southern states more power in voting, even if they would not allow slaves to vote. The north didn't want slaves who couldn't vote to be counted as part of the population so the people writing the constitution opted for "all other persons [who where not free men]" to be counted as 3/5ths of a person. 

#### The Final Product

##### Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branch
The bicameral legislature (house of reps && senate) had the HoR represent the voice of the people (reelection every 2 years) and had the senate try to act as the more aristocratic/stable & "wise" chamber. Electoral colleges have citizens vote for state electors who in turn vote for the president (executive). 

##### Seperation of Powers
To avoid conglomeration of powers to a select few, the Founding Fathers made the 3 branches of gov each of which had to be run by a diff groupd of peoples. Congress gets to make the laws, the president gets to enforce them, and the courts get to interpret them. 

##### Checks and Balances
The basic idea is that each branch can police other branches to make sure they're not going too crazy i.e. for something to actually happen, one branch has to propose, another approve, another initiate, another reapprove, etc. 

## What the Framers Coudnl't Know
The FFs didn't have all the knowledge that we do today and they could not have imagined how the US would be like today, so their attempt at the constitution was the best for its time, but meager by today's standards. The FFs had some limits on what they could think up and compromise on. Compromises had to be made in order to achieve the constitution. Even after the ratification of the constitution, it still had some bad elements. 

##### Amendments
The 13-15th amendments abolished slavery and the 19th amendment gave women the right to vote. 

## Federalism
Federalism is a political system in which power is distributed between the states, national, regional, and provincial levels. In some areas, the national power is supreme, while in others, the state, or regional power is supreme. In federalism, each level of government has its own power that is independent but other parts of its power that is dependent on the other levels. 

An alternative to federalism is the unitary system which basically has the seat of power be the national government leavning states and local govs with pretty much no power most of the time. In a confederal system, local units hold all the power, the complete opposite of the unitary system. 

The national gov has the power to declare war, aquire territory, and other things. **Dual federalism** is the theoretical representation of the formal distribution of powers explained in the constitution; every level of government is independent of each other level and is supreme in its layer of influence. In practice, **cooperative fedralism** shows that the levels of government mingle in each others areas of influence and have some piwer in them. Basically, the idea of CF is that the different levels of government work together on a single issue (like education). The national gov started out weaker when the constitution was first put in place but has become increasingly powerful over the last 200 years at the expense of the states.

Land was a commodity in earlier America, but as it became more limited, money became the primary commodity that the national gov would distribute (endowments). The national/federal gov can influence state behavior and policy in three ways:
- Categorical Grants:
    - The federal gov creates a set of criteria that, if people fit, get money which is also federally regulated ("strings attatched"). Before an individual can get this aid, however, the state must first comply with the program. **Project grants** are for projects that need money like building schools or highways. **Formula categorical grants** are given based on how many and the type of people in istrict fit into a category. 
- Block grants:
    - These are a more generalized form of funding which many projects might share. This allows states to be more flexible with the way that they spend their moeny. This type of funding however gives "credit" to the statespeople who used the money in their clever way, which could lead senators to lose electoral votes. 80% of federal funding remains as categorical grants
- Revenue Sharing:
    - Similar to block grants in that the national gov gives large lumps of money to states to use at their own discretion. This money is distributed evenly among the states, regardless of need or size. 
- Unfunded Mandates:
    - These are policy enforcments without any external funding given to pusue the mandate given by the national gov
