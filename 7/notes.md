# Lesson: Political Parties

### Political Parties Overview
Political parties are informal institutions in the democratic system. People will will form groups with others who think alike. The founding fathers opposed factions (groups in society) because they didn't want one group to become all powerful. Defining political parties goes like so:
- a group of citizens who agree on major issues facing the nation
- the group works to make public policies to reflect their views
- group promotes their ideas and policies by gaining control of government through nomination and election
- political parties are distinct because they nominate candidates for political office and sponsor their candidates campaigns

Parties act as links between us and the government and provide the basis for interaction between us and officials in the government. Parties also act as a platform for officials in different levels of government (local to national) to interact with each other. Parties (not all) also give a place for interest groups to express their opinions. 

### The Two Party System
The US is unique in its two party system and has periods of time where one party will control the government (holds a majority of seats in congress) known as party eras (last for 25-40 years). There are 5 major party eras in US history. 

### Distribution of Powers
A party's platform is something that describes that party's values and stance on issues, endorsment of policies, and the campaigns promise. These platforms are made at political conventions.
