# Lesson 12.2: Civil Liberties 

### Civil Liberties and Freedom of Speech
When the constitution was drafted there was disagreement between the federalists and anti-federalists since the AFs thought the const made a government that was too strong. They agreed to ratify the constitution in return for the adaptation of the Bill of Rights (federalists didn't think this was needed). The Bill of Rights (BoR) gives an individual rights guaranteed by the government - **civil liberties** are these guaranteed rights. **Civil rights** are the extension of government actions to secure rights for all citizens.

The rights of individuals can conflict with each other and with societal needs (school prayer & drug laws). There are limits to our freedom however since we live in a non-anarchic government - we give up some freedom to live in order. The **harm principle** is a rule of thumb for how we figure out what liberties we can't have - as long as you don't harm or threaten to harm anyone, you should be free to do that activity; what constitutes harm though is ambiguous and is interepreted by the courts. 

Freedom of speech encapsulates not just speaking but all expression. Free speech is essential for:
- Allowing citizens to be informed
- Sharing ideas and opinions
- Criticizing government
- Preventing censorship
- In summary - freedom of info and its exchange is essential for democracy. 
There is constant debate about what speech should be protected or not (freedom of speech is not an absolute right). Some speech that has been blocked are:
- Seditious speech (one that incites violence against the government | citical of government); however this speech is protected so long as it does not lead to any physical confrontation
- Symbollic speech (speech that uses actions more than words); gov is more content with regulating this type of speech more than free speech. 
- Fighting words / hate speech is not protected (speech that is intended to incite disturbance or violence)
- Offensive speech is protected (speech that someone finds annoying or bothering)
- Obscene material - hard to determine what is obscene and what isn't. Instead of the SC trying to figure out what is and isn't obscene over and over they use the Miller test --> something is obscene if 1. solely appeals to turn you on sexually, 2. lacks in educational or artistic content, 3. violates local standards of decency (this is a must for something to be considered obscene)
