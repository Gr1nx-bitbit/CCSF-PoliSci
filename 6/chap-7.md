# Chapter 7: Participation and Voting (168-198)

Older citizens are much more likely to vote than younger citizens but younger people are also more likely to participate in politics in unconventional ways(168). 

### Democracy and Political Participation
**Political Participation** is the actions of private citizens looking to influence or support government or politics. **Conventional participation** is routine political participation that uses instituational channels and is acceptable to the dominant culture (170). **Unconventional participation** is uncommon behaviour that challenges mainstream institutions and dominant culture (170). Some unconvential behavior can become **terrorism** which is defined as premeditated, politically motivated violene used against noncombatants by groups or clandestine agents; seeks to destroy government, not influence it (171). 

### Unconventional Participation
Bloody Sunday is an example (171-172). **Direct action** is a form of unconventional participation in which crowds are gathered to confront businesses and local governments to demand a hearing (172). 

### Conventional Participation 
A political system isn't democratic if its citizens can't influence the government through its institutions (meeting with officials, candidates - 175).
