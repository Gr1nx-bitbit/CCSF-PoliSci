# Chapter 7: Participation and Voting (168-198)

Older citizens are much more likely to vote than younger citizens but younger people are also more likely to participate in politics in unconventional ways(168). 

### Democracy and Political Participation
**Political Participation** is the actions of private citizens looking to influence or support government or politics. **Conventional participation** is routine political participation that uses instituational channels and is acceptable to the dominant culture (170). **Unconventional participation** is uncommon behaviour that challenges mainstream institutions and dominant culture (170). Some unconvential behavior can become **terrorism** which is defined as premeditated, politically motivated violene used against noncombatants by groups or clandestine agents; seeks to destroy government, not influence it (171). 

### Unconventional Participation
Bloody Sunday is an example (171-172). **Direct action** is a form of unconventional participation in which crowds are gathered to confront businesses and local governments to demand a hearing (172). 

### Conventional Participation 
A political system isn't democratic if its citizens can't influence the government through its institutions (meeting with officials, candidates - 175). **Supportive behavior** is conventional participation that shows support for the country's current political system. **Influencing behaviour** is conventional behavior that looks either for particular benefits or general policy changes (175). Not in my backyard (NIMBY phenomenon - 176). Political participation activies range from low initiative to high intiative (177). **Class action lawsuits** are legal actions brought on by an individual or a group on behalf of mroe people in similar circumstances (177). **Voter turnout** is the percentage of elegible voters that actually voted (178).

### Participating Through Voting
**Suffrage** and **franchise** both mean the right to vote (180). Franchise in the US started to expand in the 1800's and was pretty restrictive at first (180). While the 15th amendment have black poeple the right to vote, other voting reqiurements were put in place to prevent them from making much impact such as litercay tests (180). **Progressivism** is a philosophy of political reform based on goodness and wisdom and distrusts special interests (183). A **direct primary** is a state run preliminary election in which voters choose candidates from each political party (183). **Recall** is the removing of an elected official from office (183). A **referendum** is an election on a policy issue (183). An **initiative** is a vote to have an issue voted on either by legislature or voters; fancy petitition (184). While voter turnout in the US is pretty low compared to other European countries, we have a lot more elections than most other nations (186). 

### Explaining Political Participation
The **standard socioeconomic model** is a relationship between socioeconimic status and concenitional participaition; those with more money do more particpation (188). Younger people are more involved in unconverntional participation (188). Voter turnout decreased due to the 26th amendment which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 (189-190). Change in attitude towards politics also probably decreased voter turnout (190). Registering to vote is a high initiative aspect of voting (191). Citizens also have to learn about the scores of candidates they have to vote for which is another high intiative task (192).

### Participation and Freedom, Equality, and Order
Freedom in political participation favors those with resources (192).
