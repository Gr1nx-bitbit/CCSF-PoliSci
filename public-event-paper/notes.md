[Here](https://www.assembly.ca.gov/media/assembly-select-committee-offshore-wind-energy-california-20241018) is the link to the assembly that I watched and the rest of this document is for notes that I got from it. By the way, the actual meeting starts at 00:31:45

## Notes
Thank you's for people until 34:30. While most off-shore wind energy will be in Federal waters, state level issues consist of (36:30):
- port development
- electrical transmission
- workforce development
- labor agreements
- a lot more stuff
Communities who host the off-shore wind energy suppliers are integral parts of the solution (37:15). Need to give money to ocean protection council and other councils/agencies for offshore monitoring and science (37:30). 

### PANEL 1: AB 525 Final Report (Strategic Plan - 46:20)
Summary --> Policies to support building of windmills as well as permitting. AB 525 and the production of offshore wind would help balance the energy grid and make it more reliable and redundant - provides skilled and trained jobs, supply chains, and other benefits. creates more innovation for science and research (53:51) -- AB 525 was passed to identify suitable sea space, and develope plans (54:20). The policies are tax funded. While this mission is tax funded it creates billions of dollars in economic growth - it supplys jobs ranging from R&D to infrastructure development (58:45). Possible consequences of the project (1:00:00). Be aware of project's effects on communities. 

#### PANEL 1: Q&A Summary
Offshore wind is a catalyst for making the energy grid better (1:09:30) | How long will it take to build electric transmission (getting energy from offshore to consumers)? Said to be done by 2030 but permitting, citing, and building would take longer --> no answer really (1:13:00) |

### Panel 2: Implementation
Our windmills will be tethered to the ocean floor instead of being in shallow water - building the plane as we're flying it - will we be able to make this tech? --> already have the engineering, it's just scaled up (1:21:00) | What is *capacity building*? --> providing resources for the communities who are involved with the projects | how transparent is the survey work? --> there is a desire to share data

### Panel 3: Understand how habitat and marine life interacts with offshore wind energy.
So far most measured impacts are either negligible or mitagable. Currently monitoring sea and marine stuff. Data gotten from monitoring will be publically available. 

### Panel 4
Have conversations started yet? --> Conversations about capacity building haven't been started yet between OSW developers the communities which are hosting and being affected however Atlas winds are cordial and will return phone calls and won't hide from people who want to know about the project | BOEM gave info late to tribes and tribes did a great deal of outreach to Atlas winds | effort is being put into righting wrongs done onto tribal and local communities but it hasn't been felt yet. 

#### Why offshore wind
cleaner energy - creates jobs for people
These projects will create a lot of jobs but a lot of the time labor is outsourced due to scale which can take away from community jobs

## Comments
Putting emphasis on tribal and community involvement.
