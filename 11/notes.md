# Lesson 11.2: US Supreme Court and the Federal Judiciary
### The Rule of Law
The "rule of law" is the idea that "we are a nation of laws and not of men." Constitution is the ultimate source of power and is radical since it has the ability to override the will of people. 

### US Supreme Court (SC) and the Federal Judiciary
The SC is the only one specifically mentioned in the constitution but congress can also make other courts if it deems it necessary. Congress made 3 levels of federal courts:
- Supreme Court
- Circuit Courts (Court of Appeals)
- District Courts
Each state has its own court system on top of the federal ones. There are 94 **district courts** (at least one for each state) whose purposes are:
- Trial courts of general jurisdiction and lowerst level in the federal courts
- Hear both criminal and civil cases
- Juries are responsible for the verdict
The Appeal Courts:
- Hear appeals from district courts
- Consist of panels of 3 or more judges
- new evidence or witnesses are presented
- Decide whether previous decisions made on trial were correct
The SC is the highest court and the court of last appeal. It can either rule a previous trials decision/outcome as correct, incorrect, or they can send the case back to a lower court for retrial. Which cases the SC hears is decided in private by the SC Justices - 4 justices need to agree to hear a case for it to be heard. Reasons for which cases get picked are on the tab. No formal qualifications to be a SC justice but most comes from presitgious universities. The way state judges are elected depends on the state but is fairly standard with popular votes or appointment. Federal judges get appoionted through the process of:
- presedential nomination
- majority approval by senate | first the Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearning to vet the nominee then the whole senate asks questions to approve
- appointment by president
Being a SC justice usually turns more conservative people into more moderate or liberal justices. 

### Development of Judicial Review
After John Adams lost the election in 1800, he signed a whole bunch of commisions for nominees or something. Jefforson didn't want these commissions to be considered but it would have been worse for the Cheif of Justice to just ignore the would-be appointees so instead, the guy gave the courts the power to review presidential/execute branch stuff (Jefforson argued the SC could not do this) and denied Marburrys commision (idk who that is). This resulted in the SC's power of judcial review - the ability to null and void acts of the other two branches of government.
